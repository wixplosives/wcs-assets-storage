# wcs-assets-storage

This repository is for storing and serving static resources for the WCS via GitHub Pages.
The resource is accesible on `https://wixplosives.github.io/wcs-assets-storage/{RESOURCE_PATH}` (for example https://wixplosives.github.io/wcs-assets-storage/add-panel/image-placeholder.jpg)

IMPORTANT: This repo is now replaced with https://github.com/wixplosives/codux-assets-storage and should be deleted once users update their Codux to the newer versions.
